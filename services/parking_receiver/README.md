# Parking Receiver

- Authors: SÃ©bastien Mosser & Kalvin Khuu
- Version 2024.10

## Rationale

This service acts as the scanner receiver deployed at the front gates of a parking lot to let in permit holders. 
It receives the raw data sent by scanned transponders (using MQTT), and pushes them into the Parking system (using a regular AMQP queue).


## Technologies

- Java 19 (LTS)
- Spring Boot 3.3.2
- RabbitMQ (AMQP and MQTT)

## How to use locally

### Operating the service 

To compile the service registry on your computer:

```
parking_receiver $ mvn clean package
```

To start the service registry locally:

```
parking_receiver $ mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

When ran locally, the service assumes the infrastructure is up and running on `localhost`.
